hi there - welcome to the pdf generation class..

to install, put all the files in the indicated directories.

make sure that the web server has write permission to the 'fonts' sub-directory, the first time it uses each font it creates a serialized afm file which is much faster on subsequent uses.

then view the readme.php file through the web browser, this should produce a pdf document (streaming) which contains the documentation.

and problems, write to us as pdf@ros.co.nz, or try downloading the zip file from the site:

http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf/

there pdf documentation is pre-generated there, and there is a live demo to play with too.


have fun.
